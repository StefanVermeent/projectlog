\title{Log a custom milestone to git}
\usage{
log_milestone_misc(..., milestone_type, commit_message)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Character, a vector of files that you want to commit.
Use "." to commit all changed files. Use \code{\link[gert::git_status]{gert::git_status()}}
to get an overview of all the files that have been changed since the
last commit.}

\item{milestone_type}{Character, A unique identifier for the milestone.
Examples could be "preregistration" or "submission". Make sure that the
identifiers are the same across similar commits to be able to link them
together later on. Spaces are not allowed. Preferably use a single word
or link multiple words (e.g., 'submission_to_journal').}

\item{commit_message}{A message that will be added to your commit to Github.
Here, you can give more detailed information about the nature of the changes.}
}
\value{
Nothing. This function is called for its side-effects.
}
\description{
This function can be used to log important milestones to GitHub that are
not covered by any of the log_milestone.
For example, you could use this function to commit the final version of
a preregistration or to commit a submission to a scientific journal.
see \code{\link[OSgit::log_changes]{OSgit::log_changes}} for a very similar function that
can be used for more minor commits (i.e., non-milestone changes to your
project.)
